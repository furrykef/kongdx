Running the emulator
--------------------
The emulator is not easily runnable by the public at this time,
because doing so would involve distributing data ripped from the ROMs.
The ROMs themselves are also in a non-standard format.


Building the source
-------------------
To build, you will need Marat Fayzullin's Z80 core. It has not been
included because it is not open-source software under the Open Source
Definition.
