Running the emulator
--------------------
The emulator is not easily runnable by the public at this time,
because doing so would involve distributing data ripped from the ROMs.


Building the source
-------------------
We use CMake: http://www.cmake.org/

You will need SDL to build.


Misc. notes
-----------
A ton of credit goes to MAME. Although I didn't take any code from it,
most of my knowledge of the Donkey Kong hardware comes directly from
the MAME source.
