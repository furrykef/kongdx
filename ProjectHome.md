This is an emulator for the arcade game Donkey Kong, with enhanced features such as custom graphics and sound, and even gamepad rumble. (At least, once these features are implemented!)

**NOTE** - I ran into some fundamental problems with how to handle palette swapping in an artist-friendly fashion. I don't know if this issue will ever be resolved, so the project is currently moribund.
