TODO:
* Z80 core GPL compliance (note changes and date of change)
* Too many global variables
* Not enough modularity?
* No error checking (esp. checking to see if files aren't found or are wrong dimensions/bpp)
* Z80 code gives lots of warnings in VC++
* Make SDL_mixer optional instead of required
* Use OpenGL instead of SDL for video (higher performance)?
* We don't reload graphics when toggling fullscreen (fullscreen mode may have different pixel format)
* Improper speed throttling
* Improper method of playing SFX (doesn't allow overlapping sounds of the same type, so will occasionally drop samples)
* Game assumes you're launching it from CWD (especially unlikely to be true on Unix)
* dkongjp has a different gfx ROM from dkong. What is the difference?
* CRC check ROMs
* Integrate functionality of gfxrip.py into emulator
* Allow ripping graphics from e.g. Japanese ROM
* Donkey Kong Junior? Mario Bros.?
* Does WIN32 get #define'd on MinGW? What about Cygwin?
* Picking up hammer spams "score" sound for 67 frames -- what to do? May be best to analyze how the original hardware worked...
* Are the sparks circling DK's head when he falls supposed to be dark orange or bright orange?
* Game occasionally (but rarely) crashes on exit (by clicking X in corner of SDL window)
* Move source to a 'src' directory?


Sound code:
* Hammer grab sound plays only once, not twice, when Mario picks up hammer. (This is because the game spams the "score" sound register for 64 frames, expecting the sound to play again after it finishes the first time.)
