TODO:
* Virtually everything :)
* Debug build is broken (can't link against SDL properly)
* Too many global variables
* Not enough modularity
* No error checking (esp. checking to see if files aren't found or are wrong dimensions/bpp)
* Contact Marat Fayzullin about use of his Z80 core (per his request to be notified of all projects using it)
  ...unless we switch to another Z80 core early on, of course
* SDL_Init doesn't enable threading or whatever it is on non-Win32 systems
