TODO:
* Virtually everything :)
* Too many global variables
* Not enough modularity
* No error checking (esp. checking to see if files aren't found or are wrong dimensions/bpp)
* SDL_Init doesn't enable threading or whatever it is on non-Win32 systems
* Z80 code doesn't use stdint.h (or a replacement for it); simply assumes uint16 = unsigned short, etc.
